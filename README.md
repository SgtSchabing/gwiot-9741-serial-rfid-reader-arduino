# gwiot-9741-serial-rfid-reader-arduino
small library to decode the data from an ebay 125khz rfid reader via softwareSerial on an Arduino.
Check which Arduino pins can be used for the SoftwareSerial Library, on an Uno for example, 
you can connect the TX line of the Reader to Arduino Pin 2.

I'm by far anything but professional, don't expect anything nicely written or something. 
I'm just trying to apply some stuff I learned in uni in beginners C++ course.
I'm happy for any suggestions or improvements.
